# PythonOop Project

This project is designed to explore fundamental and advanced concepts of Python programming with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project structure includes various files demonstrating Python features, project implementations, and with some architecture diagram to provide a comprehensive view of OOP programming in Python.

## Project Structure

The directory structure is organized as follows:

## File Descriptions

### OOP Concept Files

- **`a0Notes.py`**:  
  A foundational file that provides an introduction to OOP concepts in Python. It includes explanations of class, object, and method vs function, setting up a foundation for the subsequent files.

- **`a1atm.py`**:  
  Implements an **ATM simulation project**, demonstrating OOP principles like encapsulation and data abstraction. It includes classes for handling ATM functionalities such as account balance, deposits, and withdrawals.

- **`a2fraction.py`**:  
  Handles **fractional arithmetic** with classes that implement operator overloading, allowing fraction objects to support arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) as if they were built-in numeric types.

- **`a3passByRef.py`**:  
  Explains **pass-by-reference** in Python, showing how mutable objects are affected when passed to functions. This file is helpful for understanding how Python manages memory and object references.

- **`a4collectionOfObject.py`**:  
  Demonstrates **collections of objects** by managing multiple instances of a class within lists or dictionaries. This is useful for applications that need to handle multiple similar entities, like an employee management system.

- **`a5static.py`**:  
  Covers **static methods and variables** in Python. Static methods are independent of class instances, serving as utility functions related to the class, while static variables are shared across all instances.

- **`a6aggregation.py`**:  
  Demonstrates **aggregation**, a "has-a" relationship, where a class contains references to objects of other classes. For example, a `Car` class might contain an `Engine` object, showing how classes can be composed together.

- **`a7inheritance.py`**:  
  Illustrates **single inheritance**, where a class derives from one parent class. This file explains the basic structure and benefits of inheritance, such as code reuse and improved maintainability.

- **`a8inheriteWithSuperKey.py`**:  
  Shows the usage of the `super()` function to call parent class methods. This file demonstrates how child classes can extend or modify the behavior of their parent classes by using inherited methods.

- **`a9typesOfInheritanca.py`**:  
  Explores various **types of inheritance** in Python, such as multiple, multilevel, and hybrid inheritance. Each type is described with examples to illustrate scenarios where it might be useful.

- **`a10inheritancePolymorphism.py`**:  
  Combines **inheritance with polymorphism**, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the object's type. Polymorphism enables classes to define methods with the same name that behave differently, offering flexibility in OOP design.

<!-- ### Project Files

- **`projBMSystem.py`**:  
  A **Body Mass System (BMS)** project that uses classes to calculate BMI and assess health status. This project applies OOP principles to health and fitness applications, with methods for BMI calculations and classifications.

- **`projCurrConv.py`**:  
  A **Currency Converter** using OOP principles. Classes in this file handle currency conversions, exchange rates, and possibly real-time data for financial applications.

- **`projRectangle.py`**:  
  Demonstrates the properties and operations of **rectangles** using OOP. This project includes calculations for area and perimeter, showcasing encapsulation of geometrical data.

- **`projectCcy.py`**:  
  A utility project for managing **currency abbreviations**. It includes mappings for country names to their currency codes, useful for financial applications like currency conversion.

- **`projectIrctc.py`**:  
  A **Railway Ticket Booking System** inspired by IRCTC, this project simulates the booking, cancellation, and viewing of train reservations. It is an example of how OOP can model real-world applications in transportation.

- **`projectLength.py`**:  
  A **Length Conversion** tool that converts between different units of length. This project uses classes to encapsulate data and methods related to unit conversion.

- **`projectTicketBooking.py`**:  
  A **Generic Ticket Booking System** that could support multiple event types or travel options. This project emphasizes the use of OOP for managing reservations, payments, and user interactions in a booking system.

- **`countryCurrencyShortName.py`**:  
  A mapping utility that associates **country names with their currency abbreviations**. It supports currency-related projects by providing a quick reference for currency codes.

### Additional Resources

- **Architecture Diagram** (`Architecture_Diagram.png`):  
  This diagram illustrates the overall architecture and relationships among various OOP components within this project, serving as a visual guide for understanding the structure and flow of the codebase.

## Usage

Each file and directory can be explored independently, with a suggested starting point in the `a0Notes.py` file for an overview of core OOP concepts. For a structured learning experience, follow the sequence of files (`a1atm.py` to `a10inheritancePolymorphism.py`) and review project implementations as examples of OOP applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)
